# modular-geodome
This is the repo for a modular geodesic dome that is designed to be easily transportable.

The prototype design is documented in [`ccc-prototype`](ccc-prototype/README.MD) and contains the parts list and manufacturing instructions for the prototype. It does NOT include instructions for a covering as that was not included as part of the prototype.

## Design goals

The goals of this project are:
- A modular, homogenous system that allows interchangabiltiy of parts
- Expandability, the combination of multiple kits should allow for the production of a variety of structures
- Reusability, all parts should compact down and be reusable
- Transportability, a standard single kit should fit in normal transport size constraints

The non-goals of this project (and thus parameters that can be sacrified) are:
- Ease of assembly, spending an extra few hours on put-up/tear-down for easy transit is considered a valid exchange
