# The first prototype

This prototype was built for CCC camp 2023

## Design details

The dome for CCC camp was designed on a short time spand and as such any success was considered as being acceptable

### Terminology

For this prototype these keywords were attempted to be used:
- Thin - 20mm Tubing
- Thick - 25mm Tubing
- Long
    - Tubes - Tubes that extend to full length
    - Plates - Plates intened for producing full length tubes; vertex to first hole spacing of 70mm
- Short
    - Tubes - Tubes that extend to the shorter length of the V2 geodesy
    - Plates - Plates intened for producing full length tubes; vertex to first hole spacing of 60mm

## Manufacturing details

The dome was primarily manufactured at the local hackspace, or bought from external suppliers.

### Parts list

This may be better formatted into a table but below is a parts list

- 65 drilled tubes - 20mm OD - 2mm Wall
    - Drilled with 3 full sized holes in each end
    - \>30 drilled with extra holes to allow for shortening
    - 1 cold spare that was not drilled off site
- 65 drilled tubes - 25mm OD - 2mm Wall
    - Drilled with 3 full sized holes in each end
    - \>30 drilled with extra holes to allow for shortening
    - 1 cold spare that was not drilled off site
    - Some had defects from manufacturing (extra holes from machine calibration)
- 140 thin pipe spacers
- 140 thick pipe spacers
- 70 short end plates - 5051 Alu
- 80 long end plates - 5051 Alu
- 400 M4x30 A4-80 Hex Head Bolts
- 200 M4x25 A4-80 Cap Head Bolts
- 1200 M4x0.5 A2 thin washers
- 700 M4 A2 Dome nuts
- 50 M5x90 A4-80 Hex Head Bolts
- 50 M5 A2 Dome Nuts
- 100 M5 A2 Penny washers
- 280 20 degree angled plates
    - These were not produced in sufficient quantity
    - Additional parts of 10 and 30 degree were added, see event details for more info

### Caveats

While the idea was to ensure full kit homogeneouty, this was not achieved during the initial attempt, due to an inability to machine drill the holes required

Inadequate angled plates were produced

## Event details

The dome was both assembled and disassembled successfully at CCC Camp 2023. Damage was sustained during the disassembly due to the method that was attempted to be used.

### Assembly

On the end fixings, some of the printed spacers for the thin pipe were oversized; this required filing to fix, resulting in a vastly longer assembly than was ideal. The thick tubes wiggled. Assembling took vastly too long due to inadquate instructions, but once people were instructed, all operations parallelised well

### Usage

The entire dome is was used by many people with most approving.

### Dissasembly

The idea for dissassembly was to drop the beams of the lowest ring out first, leaving it on the floor to be disassembled, before repeating up the dome.This did not work well, partly due to a lack of instruction, and partly to inadequate instruction, and partly due to inadequate people. This resulted in end plate flexing, but the structure is otherwise still usable.

## Changes for next prototype

The end plates were heavily bent, they should be thickened up and likely produced out of a stainless alloy instead of aluminium
